    "     We’ll now take an in-depth look at the Matplotlib tool for visualization in Python. Matplotlib is a multiplatform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line. IPython’s creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn’t have time to review the patch for several months. John took this as a cue to set out on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003. It received an early boost when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported Matplotlib’s development and greatly expanded its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish. This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib. It has led to a large userbase, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have begun to show their age. Newer tools like ggplot and ggvis in the R language, along with web visualization toolkits based on D3js and HTML5 canvas, often make Matplotlib feel clunky and old-fashioned. Still, I’m of the opinion that we cannot ignore Matplotlib’s strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine. Recent Matplotlib versions make it relatively easy to set new global plotting styles (see “Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets”), and people have been developing new packages that build on its powerful internals to drive Matplotlib via cleaner, more modern APIs—for example, Seaborn (discussed in “Visualization with Seaborn”), ggplot, HoloViews, Altair, and even Pandas itself can be used as wrappers around Matplotlib’s API. Even with wrappers like these, it is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib’s syntax to adjust the final plot output. For this reason, I believe that Matplotlib itself will remain a vital piece of the data visualization stack, even if new tools mean the community gradually moves away from using the Matplotlib API directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Matplotlib Tips\n",
    "Before we dive into the details of creating visualizations with Matplotlib, there are a few useful things you should know about using the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing matplotlib\n",
    "Just as we use the np shorthand for NumPy and the pd shorthand for Pandas, we will use some standard shorthands for Matplotlib imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting Styles\n",
    "We will use the plt.style directive to choose appropriate aesthetic styles for our figures. Here we will set the classic style, which ensures that the plots we create use the classic Matplotlib style:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this section, we will adjust this style as needed. Note that the stylesheets used here are supported as of Matplotlib version 1.5; if you are using an earlier version of Matplotlib, only the default style is available. For more information on stylesheets, see “Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets”.\n",
    "\n",
    "show() or No show()? How to Display Your Plots\n",
    "A visualization you can’t see won’t be of much use, but just how you view your Matplotlib plots depends on the context. The best use of Matplotlib differs depending on how you are using it; roughly, the three applicable contexts are using Matplotlib in a script, in an IPython terminal, or in an IPython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting from a script\n",
    "If you are using Matplotlib from within a script, the function plt.show() is your friend. plt.show() starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.\n",

    "    Data Visualization is the process of presenting data in the form of graphs or charts. It helps to understand large and complex amounts of data very easily. It allows the decision-makers to make decisions very efficiently and also allows them in identifying new trends and patterns very easily. It is also used in high-level data analysis for Machine Learning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  Data visualization can be done with various tools like Tableau, Power BI, Python.\n",

    "Matplotlib is a low-level library of Python which is used for data visualization. It is easy to use and emulates MATLAB like graphs and visualization. This library is built on the top of NumPy arrays and consist of several plots like line chart, bar chart, histogram, etc. It provides a lot of flexibility but at the cost of writing more code.\n",
